      <div class="col-lg small-text">
        Alpha Online is a series of group conversations that explore life, spirituality and faith through a Christian lens. We create a non-judgmental and open environment where it’s easy for anyone who is an atheist, skeptic or just curious about faith to explore questions of life with new friends.
        <br><br>
        If you want to know more we'd love to invite you to try Session 1 of Alpha Online. It will be a fun evening where you can find out if Alpha is for you. We’ll be running Alpha in July and August - so find a time that works and join us!

            7:40-8:10PM* SMALL TALKS WITH BIG IDEAS
            Each Alpha evening features a 25 minute film. Designed to inspire more questions than provide answers, these short films explore the big issues around faith and unpack the basics of Christianity, addressing questions such as Who is Jesus? and How can we have faith?  Watch the film each week from the comfort of your home through the link we will send you. Easy!

            8:10PM-8:45PM* DISCUSS THE QUESTIONS THAT MATTER TO YOU 
            The entire night builds towards this peak experience: after the film you will be put into a virtual breakout room and your hosts will lead conversations in small groups where you can share your thoughts about faith and life and hear from others in your group. You can feel free to say whatever you like or as little as you like, it's up to you.
